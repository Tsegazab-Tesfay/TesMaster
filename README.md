## Using various Natural Language Processing Techniques to Automate Information Retrieval

> #### setup: 
              (1) Personal computer for development.
              (2) Minimum requirements for the PC are a 512GB hard drive,
                  8GB RAM, and an Intel i7 processor.
              (3) Tensorflow, Keras.
              (4) Since the investigation requires data preparation and the creation of 
                  several models, it was important to utilize the Google Colab service, which 
                  allows for the utilization of GPU/CPU resources to run resource-intensive algorithms.
