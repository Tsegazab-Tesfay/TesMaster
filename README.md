# APPMAS-1 21H i Applied Data Science
## Using various Natural Language Processing Techniques to Automate Information Retrieval

> #### setup: text file on how to setup a cluster of one namenode and three datanodes
> #### preprocessing: preprocessing using python in multiple frameworks
> #### RandomForest and MultinomialNB: TBD
> #### Dataset are in [Preprocessing](https://github.com/Tsegazab-Tesfay/DS/tree/main/preprocessing)




> #### setup: 
              (1) Personal computer for development.
              (2) Minimum requirements for the PC are a 256GB hard drive,
                  8GB RAM, and an Intel i7 processor.
              (3) Tensorflow, Keras.
              (4) Since we also investigated various deep learning models, we
              utilize the services of Google Colab service that allows us to
              leverage the GPU/CPU capacity to run resource-intensive
              algorithms.
